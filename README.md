# scouts-website
This website was created as a HND Graded Unit project at College. The project was aimed at efficient  management and  completion of all stages within the project life cycle based on client's brief. The main expectation was to create a website with adaptive screen resolution, offering the functionality required by the client in a clear manner accessible to children and teenagers.

The site was built in PHP using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, XML and JSon. It uses dummy data and content elements provided by the client.

In addition to static text elements, it has a JS photo gallery, application form, XML files data extraction and formatting.
