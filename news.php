                                    <p> A new communications strategy for Scouts Scotland has been approved by the Board. The strategy sets out to: Provide Scouts Scotland with communications that will drive and support the Scottish Strategic Plan. Improve engagement with and between members. Significantly increase awareness, perception, understanding and engagement across all non-member audiences. Maximise the use of resources available (people and financial). Provide communication support and guidance for volunteers and staff. Support Region and District teams to increase internal and external communications at a local level. An integral part of the strategy is to create a new and improved website for Scouts Scotland, which will offer a better experience for both Scout members and those interested in joining Scouting. Following member feedback from a survey that went out in the summer, work has now begun on the new website which is scheduled to launch by the end of the year – watch this space! Delivery of the communications strategy is being led by Addie Dinsmore, Head of Communications, with support from Janis McCulloch, Media and Public Affairs Officer, and Claire Simpson, Marketing and Digital Communications Officer, who joined the staff team earlier in the year.</p>

                                    <p>Colder weather doesn’t have to mean the end of outdoors activities for your Beavers. 'Bringing the Outdoors In’ is a perfect theme for this time of year and offers links to lots of different badges, including ‘My Outdoors Challenge’. Here are some simple ideas to keep the adventure going indoors. Camping inside Camping inside can be great fun and is perfect for introducing Nights Away to Beavers who may never have spent one away from home before! You could host a sleepover in your Scout hall or try the indoor accommodation at any of the Scouts Scotland National Activity Centres. The new Sir Garth Morrison Lodge at Fordell Firs National Activity Centre is perfect for Beaver colonies. Indoor campfires Create an indoor ‘campfire’ by painting kitchen roll tubes brown and adding red, orange and yellow strips of crepe or tissue paper for the flames. You can create the mood of a real campfire by switching off the lights and sing campfire songs by torchlight. If it really isn’t a campfire for your Beavers without toasted marshmallows, then fear not, all you need are tea light candles! Have the Beavers light their tea light (with appropriate supervision) and watch their faces glow as they toast their marshmallows over its flame, all from the comfort and warmth of your meeting place! Knots Learning to tie knots is a great activity for when the weather outdoors is wild! Teach the Beavers some simple knots and examples of their uses. Then put them to good use in some mini pioneering projects. Why not see if the Beavers could even design a bigger project to try outdoors when the weather isn’t so wintery. Learn about wildlife Get in touch with a local animal or wildlife charity and ask them to speak to the Beavers about how they can help with their fantastic work. You could also get your Beavers to create some bug hotels or bird feeders for around your meeting place to encourage wildlife to the area, see the RSPB website for more information or download one of the RSPB activity packs. Measure the rain With all that rain around it’s the perfect time to make a rain gauge for outside your meeting place. Beavers could make them one week, pop them outside and then measure the rain that has fallen the next. Get creative There are lots of ways to get creative at this time of year too, leaf pictures, painting pebbles and bottle gardens are always great fun. And remember...there’s no such thing as bad weather just inappropriate clothing!</p>
